Clicknado is an application which lives as an icon in the notification area of your task bar.
It listens to low-level keyboard input and responds by simulating repetitive mouse clicks for you.
This can be helpful because many games and applications require clicking at a fast rate, for prolonged times, to be effectiv.
Such constant clicking patterns can be unhealthy for your hands, especially for those who already have physical difficulties with these activities.
My hope is that this simple application will help a few people to participate in games and applications that they would not have been able to without it.
